## Ex No: 05 Design & Implementation of 1 Bit Full Adder Using Cadence EDA Tools   

### Aim:
To design and implement a 1-bit full adder circuit using Cadence EDA tools and to understand its behavior in digital arithmetic operations.

### Tools Required:
-	Personal Computer
-	Cadence Virtuoso Software
  

### SCHEMATIC SIMULATION:
PROCEDURE FOR CREATING THE SCHEMATIC SIMULATION
Commands to get into Cadence:
  
1.	Right Click and open the terminal window
2.	Type the following commands as follows and press enter.
  - csh
  - source /cadence/install/cshrc
  - virtuoso   
#### Procedure for Schematic simulation using Cadence <br/>
1.	Now two windows must open <br/>
  i) virtuoso/command interpreter window <br/>
  ii) ”Whats New…”
2.	Close the 2nd window
3.	Use 1st window i.e virtuoso window (CIW) for further processing.

  	   i.	Create a New Library
  	
       ii.	Create Schematic Cell view.
       
       iii.	Create the Symbol for schematic Cell view.
      
       iv.	Create the test Cell view.
     
       v.	Analog simulation by spectre

### Steps for Schematic Simulation using Cadence:
#### i)	Procedure for Creating New Library.
-	File –New – Library
-	Name: Give name for ur library Ex: VLSILAB_EXP_5
-	Enable Attach to an existing technology library, Click OK
-	Attach the library to the technology library gpdk045.Click OK
#### ii)	Create Schematic Cell view.
-	Go to 1st window i.e virtuoso (CIW)
-	File-New-Cell view
-	Setup the new file form
    +	Library: Select the one you created.
    +	Cell: Give the experiment name Ex: Inverter ViewSchematic
    +	Type: Schematic press OK
-	Add the required components from the libraries and make the connections.
    +	Go to instance fixed menu or use shortcut key “I” from keypad to go instances
    +	Click on browse. This opens the library browser
    +	Now select the appropriate library for components like 
    +	Gpdk45 ------------------------nmos1v, pmos1v
    +	Create Input and Output pins
    +	Make the connections by using fixed narrow wire key
    +	Click Check and Save button

#### iii)	Creating the Symbol for schematic Cell view

-	In the schematic window, execute 
     +	Create – Cell view – From Cell view
     +	The cell view from cell view window appears
     +	Check Lib Name, Cell Name, From View name must be schematic Press ok
     
-	Now Symbol generation form appears. Click Ok If No changes required
-	A new window with with default symbol is created.
-	Edit the symbol if you want to give actual symbol shape else continue.
-	Execute Create-Cell view-from cell view
-	Library Name and Cell Name must be same which you have used for schematic. Press OK
-	Check for the position of pin side.Prss OK
-	Edit for the shape by Create-Shape-Choose required options to edit.

#### iv)	Creating the new test cell view

-	Go to CIW window, Execute File-New-Cell view
     +	Setup the new file form
     +	Library: Select the one you created.
     +	Cell: Cell name must be different from the name used in schematic cell view. Ex: Inverter_test
     +	View: Schematic
     +	Type: Schematic press OK
-	Follow the step 3(ii) d to make the required connections

 ### Analog simulation by SPECTRE.
-	In test cell view window
-	Launch – ADE L(Analog Design Environment)
     +	Execute Setup—Simulation/directory/Host A new window opens
     +	Set the simulation window to spectre and click ok
     +	Execute Analysis – Choose. A window opens.
     +	Select the type and set the specifications and press OK
     +	Execute Output s—to be plotted – Select on Schematic
     +	Then Select the INPUT WIRE(Vin ) and OUTPUT WIRE(Vout) from your test Schematic using mouse
-	Execute
     + Simulation → Netlist and Run

### For Transient Analysis Settings and Output
  - In the simulation setup, choose transient analysis.
  - Specify the time range for the analysis (start and stop time).
  - Run the simulation and observe the output waveforms
